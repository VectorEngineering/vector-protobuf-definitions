/**
 * BackgroundJobStatus represents the possible states of a background job. This enum is used to track the lifecycle of asynchronous tasks like scraping jobs.  State transitions: 1. QUEUED -> IN_PROGRESS 2. IN_PROGRESS -> COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED/TIMED_OUT  Usage example: ```go job := &ScrapingJob{     Status: BackgroundJobStatus_BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS, } ```   - BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED: Default state, should not be used explicitly  - BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_QUEUED: Job is queued and waiting to be processed  - BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS: Job is currently being processed  - BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_COMPLETED: Job has completed successfully  - BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_FAILED: Job encountered an error and failed  - BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_CANCELLED: Job was manually cancelled by user  - BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS_TIMED_OUT: Job exceeded its maximum execution time
